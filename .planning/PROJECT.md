# Home Assistant Sure Petcare Integration

## What This Is

A custom Home Assistant integration for Sure Petcare devices, specifically the SureFlap Cat Flap and SureFeed Microchip Pet Feeder. It aims to provide native monitoring and control capabilities for these devices within Home Assistant, including pet flap locking/unlocking and status, and pet feeder bowl status, last seen, feeding history, and food metrics. This integration is intended to offer feature parity with existing solutions like `ioBroker.sureflap` while integrating seamlessly into the Home Assistant ecosystem.

## Core Value

Provide comprehensive native control and insights for Sure Petcare devices directly within Home Assistant, enhancing smart home automation and pet care management.

## Requirements

### Validated

(None yet — ship to validate)

### Active

- [ ] Feature parity with https://github.com/Sickboy78/ioBroker.sureflap for SureFlap Cat Flap and SureFeed Microchip Pet Feeder functionalities.
- [ ] Track portion sizes for pet feeder.
- [ ] Track remaining food for pet feeder.
- [ ] Track last feeding time for pet feeder.
- [ ] Track historical consumption for pet feeder.

### Out of Scope

- (None yet — will be explicitly defined as development progresses)

## Context

The user currently uses Node-RED or HA Automations for some control but desires more native and feature-rich integration. The ultimate goal is distribution through Home Assistant Community Store (HACS), implying development as a Python-based custom component.

## Constraints

- **Distribution**: HACS compatible.
